## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/kurucaner/apprecimate-native/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/kurucaner/apprecimate-native/issues/new). Include a clear title and description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new feature request issue on GitHub.
- Clearly describe the feature and why it would be beneficial to the project.
- Note any relevant documentation or links that would be helpful context.

### Pull Requests

- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Ensure your code adheres to the style guidelines.
- Detail the changes you made in the pull request description.

## Development Setup

Here are the steps to get you set up for local development:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.

## Style Guidelines

### Coding Style

I use `Prettier` for linting and formatting. Make sure your code has no linting errors and follows the project's style guidelines.
